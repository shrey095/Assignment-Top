/*What is OOP? List OOP concepts*/
/*OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. 
-->It's a way of structuring your code around objects that represent real-world things or concepts. 
    These objects have properties (data) and methods (functions) that define how they work.
    
   * Here are the key OOP concepts in a nutshell:
    Objects: Blueprints for creating things with properties and behaviors.
             Like a cookie cutter for making cookies.
    
    Classes: Define the properties and methods that objects of a certain kind will have. 
             Like the recipe for the cookies.

    Encapsulation: Bundles data and methods together within an object, protecting the data from outside access. 
                   Keeps your cookie recipe a secret!

    Inheritance: Lets you create new classes based on existing ones, inheriting properties and methods. 
                 Imagine making chocolate chip cookies using your base cookie recipe.

    Polymorphism: Allows objects to respond differently to the same message. 
                  Like different tools (spoons, spatulas) used for different cookie-making tasks.
